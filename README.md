# MVC5-Chat

This project was made for practice. It uses SignalR in ASP.NET to send and receive messages from all browsers connected using Websockets.
The project requires Windows Authentcation so it's not cross platform compatible. 
Another feature is that it displays how much CPU is being used on your computer using SmoothieJS for charting.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Windows installed as this requires Windows Authentication to login to the site.

## Deployment

Simply copy it to the root of your web directory.
